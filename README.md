# üöÄ FraudFlow-MLOps: Cloud-Native End-to-End Fraud Prediction System

**FraudFlow-MLOps** is a cloud-native project built on **Google Cloud** to detect fraudulent financial transactions using **data engineering, machine learning, and MLOps principles**.  
It transforms raw transaction data into real-time fraud intelligence through structured layers and explainable AI ‚Äî all running seamlessly in the cloud.

---

## üåê Project Overview

FraudFlow-MLOps demonstrates how data moves through the entire MLOps lifecycle.  
It starts from raw data ingestion, passes through cleaning and feature engineering, and ends with a trained model that can detect fraud accurately and transparently.  
The system is designed to be scalable, automated, and production-ready.

### Key Highlights
- Fully built on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**
- Layered architecture using **Bronze, Silver, and Gold** zones
- Incorporates **MLOps** concepts for automation and consistency
- Uses **SMOTE** to balance imbalanced fraud datasets
- Employs **SHAP Explainable AI** for transparent decision-making
- Designed for **real-time fraud prediction** and cloud deployment

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)** for storing raw data  
- **BigQuery** for data cleaning, validation, and transformation  
- **Python (Scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost)** for model building  
- **SHAP** for explainable AI and model interpretability  
- **Vertex AI** or **Airflow (future)** for automation and orchestration  
- **Power BI or Looker Studio (future)** for real-time dashboards

## üîÑ Data Flow: From Raw to Intelligent

### ü•â Bronze Layer ‚Äì Raw Data Zone
The process begins with a large dataset of banking transactions uploaded to **Google Cloud Storage**.  
This dataset is connected to **BigQuery** through an external table, creating the Bronze Layer.  
Here, data remains unaltered ‚Äî it serves as the single source of truth.  
We check schema consistency, row counts, and missing values before moving ahead.

---

### ü•à Silver Layer ‚Äì Clean and Validated Zone
The Silver Layer focuses on cleaning and validation.  
At this stage, duplicates are removed, null values handled, and data consistency verified.  
Exploratory checks reveal how transactions behave ‚Äî identifying unique senders, receivers, and transaction types.  
We also explore relationships such as balance changes between sender and receiver accounts to identify unusual patterns.

---

### ü•á Gold Layer ‚Äì Feature Engineering Zone
The Gold Layer converts cleaned data into features that help detect fraud.  
New attributes are added, such as:
- Difference in sender and receiver balances  
- Flags for unusually large transactions  
- Indicators for risky transaction types like TRANSFER and CASH_OUT  

This turns plain transactional data into intelligence the model can learn from.  
The Gold Layer ensures that domain understanding is embedded into the model training process.

## ü§ñ Machine Learning and Model Building

FraudFlow-MLOps trains multiple machine learning models to identify fraudulent transactions.  
Since fraud data is highly imbalanced, **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)** is used to create balanced training data, ensuring the model learns equally from both fraudulent and legitimate transactions.  

The models evaluated include:
- **Logistic Regression** for interpretability  
- **Linear SVM** for boundary-based classification  
- **Random Forest** for ensemble learning  
- **XGBoost** for boosted accuracy  
- **LightGBM** for fast and scalable learning  

Among these, **LightGBM** and **Random Forest** achieved the best results, reaching around **99.5% ROC-AUC**, meaning they could accurately detect fraud with minimal false positives.

## ‚ö° Why LightGBM Was the Best Choice

While several models performed well, **LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine)** proved to be the most effective and production-ready model for this project.

### Reasons:
1. **Fast and Scalable** ‚Äì Trains quickly even on millions of records due to its histogram-based learning.  
2. **Memory Efficient** ‚Äì Uses discrete bins for data storage, reducing computational cost.  
3. **Handles Imbalanced Data** ‚Äì Works well for fraud datasets where positive (fraud) cases are rare.  
4. **Low Latency** ‚Äì Generates predictions quickly, critical for real-time fraud detection.  
5. **Explainability** ‚Äì Integrates easily with SHAP for transparent results.  
6. **Cloud Friendly** ‚Äì Deploys smoothly to environments like Vertex AI and other production systems.

LightGBM offered the best balance of speed, accuracy, and interpretability, making it ideal for scalable cloud-based fraud analytics.

## üß† Explainable AI ‚Äì Making Predictions Transparent

Accuracy alone is not enough in fraud analytics.  
Using **SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations)**, the project shows **why** the model predicts a transaction as fraud.  

Key insights from SHAP analysis include:
- Transactions involving **TRANSFER** or **CASH_OUT** are more likely to be fraudulent.  
- Large **amounts** and drastic **balance differences** between sender and receiver indicate risk.  
- Legitimate transactions maintain predictable balance changes, while fraudulent ones deviate sharply.  

This makes the model transparent, trustworthy, and suitable for financial compliance environments.

## üìà Results Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| ROC-AUC | 0.995 |
| Accuracy | ~99% |
| False Positives | Very Low |
| Explainability | Achieved using SHAP |
| Scalability | Cloud-native, modular architecture |

The system successfully identifies suspicious transactions with near-perfect accuracy while minimizing false alarms.

## üîÆ Future Scope

The next steps for FraudFlow-MLOps focus on turning this static system into a **real-time, production-grade pipeline**.

1. **Real-Time Streaming** ‚Äì Integrate Kafka or Google Pub/Sub for live transaction ingestion.  
2. **Automation** ‚Äì Use Vertex AI or Airflow to retrain and deploy models automatically.  
3. **Drift Detection** ‚Äì Continuously monitor model performance and adapt to new fraud patterns.  
4. **Visualization** ‚Äì Build dashboards in Looker Studio or Power BI for monitoring fraud trends.  
5. **Alerts and Notifications** ‚Äì Trigger instant alerts for high-risk transactions.
